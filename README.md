This repository holds the Python script for generating a backflip trajectory using Box-FDDP algorithm. The trajectory is tested on Solo-12, a lightweight quadruped robot. It can be visualized in Gepetto, developed by LAAS-CNRS, and simulated in PyBullet. Experiments on real robot can be seen here: https://github.com/giulianodejulio/offline-trajectory-publisher.
